Task 2.1



**Part I**
Git Account
Git is our repository manager tool. If you don’t already have Git, installing it isn’t difficult. See the Git
website at https://git-scm.com and follow the instructions there to download and install on your
Platform and you can create a Git account at https://github.com. This is an important task as you
need to share your Git repo for your weekly tasks through the OnTrack.
